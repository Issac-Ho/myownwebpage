        <p>
          The Bachelor of Information (BI) program is the perfect next step in my academic journey, 
          combining my technical background with my passion for data. I have always been fascinated by 
          data—whether it’s analyzing, interpreting, or transforming it into actionable insights. 
          Through my Software Development Diploma at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), 
          I gained hands-on experience with a variety of technologies. However, I realized that while I 
          enjoyed the digital aspects of software development, my true passion lies in exploring and 
          analyzing data to uncover patterns that inform better decision-making.

          I thrive in environments where I can work with data to predict outcomes and draw meaningful 
          conclusions. My ultimate goal is to become a Data Scientist, and I believe the BI program will 
          help me achieve that. I am naturally drawn to the analytical side of problem-solving and excel 
          at identifying trends within data—skills essential for success in Business Intelligence. By 
          pursuing this program, I aim to refine these abilities, master cutting-edge tools, and position 
          myself for a fulfilling career. I am excited about applying my technical skills to real-world 
          data-driven projects and solving complex problems that drive business success.

          In my work, I am someone who thinks quickly and takes immediate action. This was evident in a 
          group project at SAIT, where we designed software for a company. As I wrote the code, new ideas 
          for features or design improvements would emerge, and instead of waiting for approval, I would 
          implement them to see how they worked. This approach allowed me to learn through action and adapt 
          quickly. When I encountered challenges, I collaborated with my teammates to troubleshoot and 
          resolve issues. This experience reinforced my belief that a balance between creativity, action, 
          and collaboration is key to success in both individual and team projects.

          I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI). My curiosity began in high 
          school when I participated in a program that introduced machine learning concepts. While the 
          program was basic, it sparked a lasting interest in AI and its potential to transform data 
          analysis. In the BI program, I look forward to taking electives focused on AI and machine 
          learning, as I believe these fields are vital to the future of Business Intelligence. AI can 
          automate data analysis, predict trends, and optimize decision-making, and I am eager to combine 
          this knowledge with my data analysis skills to further my career as a Data Scientist.

          Beyond academics, I am an optimistic person who seeks to bring positivity and happiness to others. 
          I value the time spent with others and strive to make it meaningful. Whether through humor or 
          empathy, I aim to uplift those around me and help them overcome challenges. Professionally, I want 
          to leverage data to help businesses improve decision-making, streamline processes, and create better 
          outcomes for customers and employees.

          In summary, the BI program offers an ideal opportunity to pursue my passion for data, develop new 
          skills, and contribute meaningfully to organizations. I am excited to embark on this next 
          chapter of my education and career.
